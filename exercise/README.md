# ðŸš€ Astronaut Mission Control â€“ Design Pattern Demos

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of **six core software design patterns** implemented in **Java**, themed around an **Astronaut Mission Control System**.  

It shows how **Behavioral, Creational, and Structural** patterns can be applied in realistic scenarios like space missions.

## âœ¨ Features

### Core Design Patterns Implemented

- **Observer Pattern (Behavioral)**  
  *Life Support System* notifies connected displays, alarms, and mission control when oxygen levels change.

- **Command Pattern (Behavioral)**  
  Implements *Rocket Launch*, *Abort Mission*, and *System Checks* with **undo/redo** functionality.

- **Singleton Pattern (Creational)**  
  *Mission Control Center* ensures only one global control instance.

- **Factory Pattern (Creational)**  
  *Astronaut Factory* creates different crew roles (Pilot, Engineer, Scientist) from configuration.

- **Adapter Pattern (Structural)**  
  Standardizes time formats (Earth UTC, 12h AM/PM, Mars Sol time) into a unified system.

- **Composite Pattern (Structural)**  
  Organizes *Mission Phases* (Launch, Orbit, Landing) into a hierarchy where completing a phase completes its tasks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Educational Goals

- Show **real-world use cases** of design patterns in a themed space mission.
- Provide **clean, modular Java code** thatâ€™s easy to extend.
- Each pattern demo runs independently with its own `main()` method.
- Encourage applying **SOLID principles** and **OOP best practices**.
